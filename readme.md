# Carango App

A Native Android app built with Fragments, TabLayout and other stuff, such as:

- Navigation Bar
- Tabs menu, like Instagram
- `shift + shift` to search bar, as shortcut
- `layoutbelow`
- Fragments
    - Remove `import android.app.Fragment` and replace it by **v4**: `import android.support.v4.app.Fragment`, otherwise itÂ´d have problems into tablets
- Adapters
- **RecyclerView** instead of **ListView** - Of course there are good reasons, but you have to check if you should use it, if there is an existing project that already use it and your deadline is almost getting there, you know dough so...think about it
- CardView
- JSON Libraries
    - Retrofit
    - GSON, to convert attributes
- Picasso Library to Images
